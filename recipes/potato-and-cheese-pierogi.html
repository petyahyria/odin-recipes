    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This recipe is an Ukrainian one of my Great-Grandmothers passed down from the years.
        They are great with melted butter and sauteed onions, or fry if desired. 
        They can also be frozen between layers of plastic wrap.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>water as needed</li>
            <li>5 pounds potatoes, peeled</li>
            <li>1 pound processed cheese, cubed</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>onion salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
            Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm,
            about 15 minutes; drain.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine flour, eggs and salt. Mix in a little water
            at a time until dough is somewhat stiff. 
            Roll dough in small sections about 1/4 inch thick. 
            Using a large biscuit cutter or drinking glass, make circle cuts.
        </li>
        <li>
            To make filling: Mix together potatoes, cheese, salt, pepper
            and onion salt. Fill each with 1 to 2 tablespoons of the potato mixture,
            fold over and seal edges. To cook, bring a large pot of water to boil,
            carefully dropping in one at a time; stir once. 
            They are done when they float to the top.
        </li>
    </ol>
